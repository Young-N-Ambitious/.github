# Welcome to YNA Squad

## Mission Statement
YNA plans to help 100 minorities break into tech by 2030 providing professional guidance and resources through personal development, community, and open source.

## About Us
We are a group of tech enthusiasts who began coding together in the summer of 2019. Not only do we come from a wide range of backgrounds, but we all bring something special to the Tech Industry that sets us apart. Many of us are bootcamp grads, Computer Science students, or come from other IT related fields, but we each have something in common. We are Young And Ambitious and attract like minded individuals who have the same goals and plan to leave a mark on the entire tech force. 

## Community Details
Our community is one of a kind and started with like minded individuals wanting to learn and nerd together. From day 1 we started hosting live study sessions daily, and holding each other accountable as we went through bootcamps and wrapped up other IT courses. Now since our founding members have landed multiple tech jobs, started teaching classes and began mentoring others, we have decided to continue to pay it forward and create this project to help more folks like us break into the tech industry. We continue to host study sessions, resume review workshops, job referrals, give educational advice, work on open source and career coaching all for FREE!! Many people try to navigate a new career and find a community on their own, but in the YNA family you will always have someone and/or something that you can’t find anywhere else by your side. We are a very close tech family who started from the bottom and are working with each of our members to reach the stars. If this sounds like a community that you can either thrive in or want to recruit talent from, please reach out to us at your earliest convenience. 

## Solution 
There are so many career changers and recruiters who are trying to navigate a big pool of talent and tech companies to join. YNA screens and preps all members to become hot on the market; While also providing the best talent for recruiters to scout from. Individuals will no longer have to stand the job search alone and recruiters no longer have to blind recruit, nor waste tons of money on recruiting softwares and recruiting agencies. We are a one stop shop for enhancing your career and settling your business needs.
