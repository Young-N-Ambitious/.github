# Welcome to YNA Squad

## Mission Statement
YNA plans to help 100 minorities break into tech by 2030 providing professional guidance and resources through personal development, community, and open source.

## About Us
We are a diverse group of tech enthusiasts who began coding together in the summer of 2019. We come from a wide range of backgrounds, but we all bring something special and unique to the Tech Industry, which sets us apart. While many of us are bootcamp grads, Computer Science students, and/or have come from other IT related fields, we each have something in common. We are Young And Ambitious and we attract like minded individuals who have the same goals, and plan to leave a mark on the entire tech force. 

## Community Details
Our community started with like minded individuals wanting to learn and nerd together. It has truly become one of a kind. We started by hosting live study sessions daily, and holding each other accountable as we went through bootcamps and wrapped up other IT courses. Since our founding members have landed multiple tech jobs, started teaching classes, and began mentoring others. We have decided to continue to pay it forward and create this project to help more folks like us break into the tech industry. We continue to host weekly study sessions, in addition to now offering resume review workshops, job referrals, give educational advice, work on open source projects, and even career coaching; all for FREE! Many people try to navigate a new career and find a community on their own, but in the YNA family you will always have someone and/or something that you can’t find anywhere else. We are a close tech family, all starting from zero and now working together to reach the stars. If this sounds like a community that you can either thrive in or want to recruit talent from, please reach out to us at your earliest convenience.  

## Solution 
There are so many career changers and recruiters who are trying to navigate a big pool of talent and tech companies to join. YNA screens and preps all members to become hot on the market, providing the best tech talent for recruiters to find. Individuals will no longer have to endure the job search alone and recruiters no longer have to blind recruit. YNA is a one-stop shop which aims to improve your companies profitability. Recruiting top talent for your needs.
